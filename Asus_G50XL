cfdisk /dev/sda
#Now we have to make 2 partinions (both PRIMARY): One for swap and one for system and files
#For swap partition: Size (for exampe: 4GB), Primary, Type - Linux swap / Solaris         (sda1)
#For main partition: Size (use what left), Primary, Type - Linux                          (sda2)

###Formating disk
#Format our main partition
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2

#Format swap partition
mkswap /dev/sda1

#Activate swap partition
swapon /dev/sda1

###Mount partition
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
#you can check if everything seems fine by cmd "lsblk". sda1 should be [SWAP] and sda should be /mnt

###Install Linux
#this command will only instal basic package of ArchLinux, linux kernel and basic firmware for hardware. Additionally it will instal text editor (nano).
